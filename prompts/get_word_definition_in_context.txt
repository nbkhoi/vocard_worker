"word": The English word being defined.
"partOfSpeech": The part of speech of the word.
"ipaUk": The International Phonetic Alphabet notation for the pronunciation of the word in British English.
"ipaUs": The International Phonetic Alphabet notation for the pronunciation of the word in American English.

"definition": The definition of the word in the given context.
"meaningVi": The Vietnamese meaning of the word in the context of the given definition.
"exampleSentence": An example sentence using the word in the context of the given definition.

If the word has multiple definitions, each definition should be included as a separate object within an array under the key "definitions". Ensure that the "word", "partOfSpeech", "ipaUk", "ipaUs", "pronUk", and "pronUs" fields are repeated for each definition.
